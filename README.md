# Terminal RPG aka TERPG.
## Objective of this project.
This is a PoC to develop an RPG using
the terminal and a learning project for
rust.

## What it does.
At this moment, the PoC is capable of reading maps from
a file, render them, and generate the collisions.
With that the user can navigate around the map.

It implements a very simple and rudimental engine to run
the game.

## How to navigate.
Use the `WASD`keys to move around.
Press `ESC` to exit the program.
